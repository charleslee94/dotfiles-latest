# Introduction

These are my personal dotfiles.

# Installation

run ./setup.<YOUR-OS> **FROM THE HOME DIRECTORY** aka where you expect the dotfiles to end up to create symlinks for the provided dotfiles

This will create a dotfiles folder in your home directory, with symlinks to your home directory
