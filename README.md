# Introduction

These are my personal dotfiles.

# Installation

1. Update the zsh path to use your username
2. run ./setup.<YOUR-OS> **FROM THE HOME DIRECTORY** aka where you expect the dotfiles to end up to create symlinks for the provided dotfiles

This will create a dotfiles folder in your home directory, with symlinks to your home directory

# Additional
* Install Node (TODO get this in the install script)
  Install Homebrew
  Install FASD
